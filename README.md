# A Cover Worth 1000 Words 
This repo holds the final visualization project for CS171. Using data from Google’s Vision API, and the GoodBooks data set compiled by zygmuntz on GitHub, we’ve explored how the aesthetic features of color and symbols vary across book covers of different genres, and how these variances might affect a user’s perception of the book.

# How is this repo organized?
We have organized all the files in the following directory structure

/
  
  -- css (All stylesheets used for this project)
