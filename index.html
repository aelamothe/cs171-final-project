                They say to never judge a book by its cover. But sometimes, we don't
                even consciously decide on which books get our attention in the first
                place. For example...

                            book, because of it's cover design. It's pretty cool how much

                        genre.

                                 or as little, as you'd like, about the other
                                 key features that go into making some covers
                                 so irresistible. We hope that you enjoyed
